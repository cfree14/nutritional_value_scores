<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Nutritional Value Score (NVS) is a new nutrient profiling system for assessing the nutritional value of foods in a holistic way. The NVS includes nutrients of global health priority, as well as nutrient ratios predictive of noncommunicable disease risk. It can be used to guide decision-making for nutrition policy and programs on which nutritious foods to prioritize within a given context.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NVS is calculated based on the following seven sub-scores:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Vitamin Score: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">This score reflects the quantity and quality of 11 vitamins of public health priority: folate, choline, riboflavin, thiamin, niacin, and vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D, and E.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Mineral Score:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This score reflects the quantity and quality of 5 protective minerals of public health priority: iron, zinc, calcium, potassium, and magnesium.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Essential amino acid Score (EAA): </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">This score reflects the quantity and quality of essential amino acids.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Omega-3 fatty acid Score:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This score reflects the quantity and quality of omega-3 fatty acids.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Fiber Score: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">This score reflects the quantity of fiber.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Calorie density Score: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">This score reflects the energy density of foods.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Nutrient ratios Score: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">This score reflects the increased risk for noncommunicable diseases from consuming foods (1) high in carbohydrates and low in fiber, (2) high in sodium and low in potassium, and/or (3) high in saturated fat and low in unsaturated fat.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also present a </span><strong>Nutrient Density Score (NDS)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is calculated as a weighted average of the scores for vitamins, minerals, essential amino acids, and omega-3 fatty acids. The NDS score can be used to identify nutrient dense foods to be targeted in policies and programs seeking to address essential nutrient deficiencies and associated undernutrition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the NVS and NDS have only been calculated for commonly consumed foods in two low- and middle-income countries &ndash; Indonesia and Bangladesh &ndash; as a proof of concept, but we plan to expand its application to all GAIN countries first, and all other countries globally after. In addition, the NVS and NDS have only been tested on unprocessed, minimally and moderately processed foods, recommended in food-based dietary guidelines globally. Their application to ultra-processed foods might require subsequent adaptations.</span></p>
